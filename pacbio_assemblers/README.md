# Pipeline to Assembly ONT Sequences

The aim of this pipeline is to run most recent published (or in development) assemblers of ONT reads. Some recent assemblers have demonstrated promissing results with low memory footprint. In this case, we can compare the amount of time required to run or even the memory requirements between these assemblers if we run them using the `benchmark` keyword inside the rule.

To begin with, we have 2 assemblies in the pipeline: [Flye]() and [
